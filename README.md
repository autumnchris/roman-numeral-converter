# Roman Numeral Converter

A JavaScript app that takes a given standard Arabic number and outputs its Roman numeral form.

Inspired by [my solution](https://github.com/autumnchris/freecodecamp-algorithms/blob/main/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/roman-numeral-converter.js) to the [Roman Numeral Converter algorithm](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/roman-numeral-converter) as part of the curriculum for the [Legacy JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
